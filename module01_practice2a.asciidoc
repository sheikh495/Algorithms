Work problem 2.1-2 on pages 24-25. ("Consider the procedure SUM-ARRAY...")

== Problem 1 Answer
*Initialization*: We start by stating the loop invariant. At the start of each
iteration of the loop, the variable *sum* contains the summation of the elements
in the subarray stem:[A[1:i-1]].
Initially, the subarray is empty thus sum starts as the additive
identity of stem:[0] which is indeed the sum of no elements.

*Maintenance*: At each iteration of the loop, the sum will add the element at
stem:[A[i]] (line 3) then increment stem:[i] since it's the end of the for loop.
This makes the current value of sum the summation of elements in
the subarray stem:[A[1:i-1]]. 

*Termination*: Once the loop terminates, stem:[i = n + 1]. This means that the
current summation is of elements stem:[A[1:n]]. Hence, the algorithm is correct.
